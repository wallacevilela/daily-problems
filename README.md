## Problems List

### Problem 1:

You are given an array of integers, and an integer K.</br>
Return the subarray which sums to K.</br>
You can assume that a solution will always exist.

    def find_continuous_k(list, k):
    # Fill this in.
    
    print find_continuous_k([1, 3, 2, 5, 7, 2], 14)
    # [2, 5, 7]
